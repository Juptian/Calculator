# Calculator

Lucas ( https://github.com/lucasstarsz/ ) gave me 2 hours to make a basic calculator including the following operations:
- +, minus, 
- *, /, 
- ^, (), and %
Lets see how this goes

I decided to say no to the `()` because I had only 40 minutes and I spent the first 40 minutes trying to figure out the parsing before I realized C# did it ***for*** me, so that's what `JupIsDumb.cs` is. Overall it was fun ish, once I realized C# does the hard work it was super easy going. I'd have to add the priority of opertations, as currently it just goes left to right, but that's fine. Still not a bad calculator!
